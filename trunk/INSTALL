PySWIP INSTALL
==============

PySWIP requires SWI-Prolog as a shared library since it uses ctypes to access SWI-Prolog/C functions.

You need to do the following to install a shared library enabled version of SWI-Prolog. We use version 5.6.34 of SWI-Prolog but any other recent version should work fine. Please make the necessary modifications for your environment.

These instructions are tested on a Linux system, but should also work for POSIX systems. Also, you may want to install development packages for readline and libgmp (not required for basics).

1) Get the source from: http://www.swi-prolog.org/download.html::

	$ wget http://gollem.science.uva.nl/cgi-bin/nph-download/SWI-Prolog/pl-5.6.34.tar.gz

2) Extract the archive and cd into it::
	
	$ tar xzvf pl-5.6.34.tar.gz
	$ cd pl-5.6.34

3) Configure the source with shared library enabled::

	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-shared

4) Compile the source::

	$ make

5) Install the source::
	
	$ sudo make install

6)  Create a soft link::

	$ sudo ln -s  /usr/lib/pl-5.6.34/lib/i686-linux/libpl.so.5.6.34 /usr/lib/libpl.so

Next, get and install ctypes from: http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes . Note that you don't need to install it if you are using Python 2.5.

Unpack PySwIP package and install it with, `python setup.py install`.

After you install it, you can test it with the following at the shell::

	$ python
	[ ... python info ...]
	>>> from pyswip.util import PrologRunner
	>>> prolog = PrologRunner()
	>>> prolog.query("assertz(father(michael,john))")
	[{}]
	
If you get an error, such as "libpl (shared) not found." or "FATAL ERROR: Resource not found" be sure you have installed SWI-Prolog as a share library. Check your default library directory (usually ``/usr/lib``) for ``libpl.so``.
