*1. Q:* When I import PySWIP, I get:
{{{
  libpl (shared) not found. Possible reasons:
  1) SWI-Prolog not installed as a shared library. Install SWI-Prolog (5.6.34 works just fine)
}}}

*A:* If you're on UNIX/Linux, you didn't install SWI-Prolog's shared library (which is *NOT* the default when you compile the sources yourself, and not installed by default for many distributions _such as Debian/Ubuntu_. Most probably you'll have to compile SWI-Prolog on your own; please see [INSTALL].

*A:* If you're on Windows, you need to set your path so that {{{libpl.dll}}} is found; please see [INSTALL].

*2. Q:* I get the following when  try to run a trivial PySWIP example:
{{{
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "pyswip/prolog.py", line 81, in __call__
    v.update(r)
  ValueError: dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 1; 2 is required
}}}

*A:* Upgrade your PySWIP to at least version 0.2.2.
