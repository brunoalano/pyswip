#summary Shows how to simulate having multiple SWI-Prolog knowledgebases

= Simulating Multiple Knowledgebases =

We can have only one prolog knowledgebase for each process as
confirmed in a recent thread (for JPL) (this is a limitation of the
SWI-Prolog foreign language interface):
http://www.nabble.com/JPL-error-t3911134.html

In that thread, Jan Wielemaker also says that, predicates are local to modules,
so we can use modules to simulate many databases.

== Example ==

Here's  an example to use modules to have multiple knowledgebases. The same example is also present in the examples dir. This example uses the Pythonic interface.
{{{
from pyswip import *

assertz = Functor("assertz")
parent = Functor("parent", 2)
test1 = newModule("test1")
test2 = newModule("test2")

call(assertz(parent("john", "bob")), test1)
call(assertz(parent("jane", "bob")), test1)

call(assertz(parent("mike", "bob")), test2)
call(assertz(parent("gina", "bob")), test2)

print "knowledgebase test1"

X = Variable()
q = Query(parent(X, "bob"), module=test1)
while q.nextSolution():
    print X.value

print "knowledgebase test2"

q = Query(parent(X, "bob"), module=test2)
while q.nextSolution():
    print X.value
}}}
Outputs:
{{{
knowledgebase test1
john
jane
knowledgebase test2
mike
gina
}}}
It shouldn't be hard to write a class that automatically create new
modules.

Hope it helps.

Thanks to Eli Golovinsky who brought the issue to my attention.
